    "# Data Curation\n",
    "This notebook showcases the building blocks that can be used for building a simple data curation pipeline using [NeMo Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Materials\n",
    "Before proceeding, we highly recommend looking through the following deep dive blog posts that walk you through building data curation pipelines using NeMo Curator:\n",
    "- [Curating Custom Datasets for LLM Training with NVIDIA NeMo Curator](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/curating-custom-datasets-for-llm-training-with-nvidia-nemo-curator/)\n",
    "- [Curating Custom Datasets for LLM Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with NVIDIA NeMo Curator](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/curating-custom-datasets-for-llm-parameter-efficient-fine-tuning-with-nvidia-nemo-curator/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, please checkout [our tutorials](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/tree/main/tutorials) in the repository to learn more about various functionalities that NeMo Curator provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the [Law-StackExchange dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ymoslem/Law-StackExchange) for this pipeline, which is a dataset of legal question/answers scraped from the Stack Exchange website. This notebook is the summarized version of our existing [synthetic data generation tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/tree/main/tutorials/peft-curation-with-sdg). Feel free to go through that tutorial to gain a better understanding of various NeMo Curator facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Requirements\n",
    "The NeMo dependencies are already installed in the container. However, before proceeding you need to install one dependency to follow along. Execute the following cell before getting started."
