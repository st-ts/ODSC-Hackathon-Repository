    "\n",
    "## Reading Materials\n",
    "Before proceeding, we highly recommend looking through the following deep dive blog posts that walk you through building data curation pipelines using NeMo Curator:\n",
    "- [Curating Custom Datasets for LLM Training with NVIDIA NeMo Curator](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/curating-custom-datasets-for-llm-training-with-nvidia-nemo-curator/)\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, please checkout [our tutorials](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/tree/main/tutorials) in the repository to learn more about various functionalities that NeMo Curator provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the [Law-StackExchange dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ymoslem/Law-StackExchange) for this pipeline, which is a dataset of legal question/answers scraped from the Stack Exchange website. This notebook is the summarized version of our existing [synthetic data generation tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/tree/main/tutorials/peft-curation-with-sdg). Feel free to go through that tutorial to gain a better understanding of various NeMo Curator facilities.\n",
